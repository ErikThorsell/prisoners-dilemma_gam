Genetic Algorithm Model Playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
===

This repo contains the model used to generate the results found in the report
`Game_Theory_Project.pdf`.

---

In short, the model plays the [iterated prisoner's
dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner.27s_dilemma)
in accordance to one of four strategies (details in the report) and uses
evolutionary selection to breed new strategies based on (1) how well strategy is
doing and (2) random mutation.
